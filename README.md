This is a very simple unit-test library for the C programming language.
It is a single header, single source project that builds to a static library.
You can of course also just copy the contents of 'src/' into your project,
but remember to include the LICENSE in that case.

For documentation see 'src/actest.h'. The file 'example.c' illustrates how the library
is used.
